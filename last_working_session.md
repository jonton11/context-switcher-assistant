## Analysis

### Summary of Commit `718886d678cd38125d3844cd2e289091fbb5cc26`

#### What Changed:
- **New Files Added:**
  - **`.env.example`**: A template for environment variables, specifically including `OPENAI_API_KEY`.
  - **`ai_summarizer.py`**: A new module that integrates with OpenAI's API to generate enhanced summaries of git commits using AI.
  - **`requirements.txt`**: A new file listing dependencies, specifically `openai` and `python-dotenv`.

- **Modifications in Existing Files:**
  - **`commit_formatter.py`**: 
    - Updated to utilize the new AI summarization feature. 
    - The function `write_commit_summary` now calls `get_enhanced_summary` to generate a summary of the commit using AI, rather than just writing the diff directly.
    - The output format has been adjusted to include an AI-generated analysis section.

#### Why These Changes Were Made:
- The primary goal of this commit is to enhance the commit summary generation process by integrating AI capabilities. This allows for more insightful and detailed summaries that can help developers understand the changes made in a commit without needing to analyze the raw diff manually.
- The addition of the `.env.example` file provides a clear guideline for developers on how to set up their environment for using the OpenAI API.
- The `requirements.txt` file ensures that all necessary dependencies are documented for easy installation.

#### Technical Impact and Considerations:
- **Dependency on OpenAI API**: The new functionality requires an API key for OpenAI, which must be set in the environment. Developers need to ensure they have access to this API and manage their keys securely.
- **Error Handling**: The code includes basic error handling for missing environment variables and API call failures, but further enhancements could be made to improve robustness.
- **Backward Compatibility**: The existing functionality of writing commit summaries is preserved, but now enhanced with AI analysis, ensuring that current users of the `commit_formatter.py` will not experience disruptions.
- **Potential for Future Enhancements**: This integration opens the door for further AI-driven features, such as more complex analyses or different formats for summaries, which could be beneficial for larger teams or projects.

Overall, this commit significantly improves the commit documentation process by leveraging AI, making it easier for developers to understand changes and their implications.
